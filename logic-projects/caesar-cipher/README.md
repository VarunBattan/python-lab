# Caesar Cipher

A Python command-line program that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.

## Description
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
This program allows the user to both encode and decode messages with a chosen shift value.

## Features
- Encode (encrypt) text
- Decode (decrypt) text
- Handles shift values greater than the alphabet length
- Preserves non-alphabet characters (spaces, symbols, numbers)
- Allows repeated use without restarting the program

## Project Structure
- main.py – cipher logic and user interaction
- art.py – ASCII logo used at program start

## Concepts Used
- Functions
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Lists
- String manipulation
- Modular arithmetic
